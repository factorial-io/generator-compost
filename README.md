# generator-compost

> Speed up your development workflow by quickly generating frontend patterns.

Generator compost scaffolds opinionated frontend pattern structures into your
file system. Depending on your choices it will create the following files:

    ├── _component.css
    ├── _component.js
    ├── _component.twig
    ├── _component.yaml

This is a companion tool for [pattern-lab-edition-factorial](https://github.com/factorial-io/pattern-lab-edition-factorial)
